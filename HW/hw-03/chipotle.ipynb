    "This part of the HW is based on data from an article from the New York Times's blog, *The Upshot*. In an article titled, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/17/upshot/what-do-people-actually-order-at-chipotle.html\"> \"At Chipotle, How Many Calories Do People Really Eat?\" </a>, the authors use data from about 1,800 Chipotle orders made on GrubHub. The data from this article is available here on GitHub: https://github.com/TheUpshot/chipotle . In this part of the HW, we use the data that they provide to practice working with real data. This assignment will give us some practice on manipulating, summarizing, and visualizing data with Pandas and Python.\n",

    "From the NYTimes article, \n",

    "> The data is based on about 3,000 meals in about 1,800 Grubhub orders from July to December 2012, almost all from two Chipotle restaurants: one in Washington, D.C., and another in East Lansing, Mich. ... We assume people eat only one salad, burrito bowl, burrito or set of tacos at a time. When there’s more than one of those items in an order, we assume it’s for more than one person. And we assume that groups of people who order together split side items, like chips. That’s probably untrue — there’s always one guy who eats more — but assumptions about chip division don’t have a huge impact on the overall shape of our histogram.\n",
