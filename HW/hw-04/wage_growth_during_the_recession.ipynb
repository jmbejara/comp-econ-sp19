    "Wages at the aggregate level have been found to rise during the recent recession (or at least not decline). This is surprising given that aggregate labor conditions were so weak. Many economists have viewed this as a puzzle. The goal in this question is to assess whether this is a puzzle, given that the composition of workers are changing over time. We begin by establishing the facts from which this puzzle arises. \n",

    "> The Great Recession in the United States was a severe financial crisis combined with a deep recession. While the recession officially lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, it took several years for the economy to recover to pre-crisis levels of employment and output.\n",

    "\n",
    "To study this puzzling fact, we will analyze how changing demographics might affect our aggregate measures of wages. One of our biggest concerns is that as employment rates fell, they fell more for low educated workers than high educated workers. That means the average wages we are measuring will actually be comparing different types of workers in 2010 relative to 2006. This could potentially explain why wages are rising. We will attempt to compensate for this by constructing a demographically adjusted time series for wages. \n",

(You need to download the group quarters variable).  Wages will be defined as annual earnings (last year) divided by annual hours (last year).  Annual hours can be computed by multiplying weeks worked last year by usual hours worked (last year). You should do this for a sample of all workers with a positive wage last year. Typically, you can convert to real wages using any deflator you wish. Here, I will require using the CPI99 variable to convert to 1999 dollars. (Note: Many economists like to use the June CPI-U. June is in the middle of the year and, for that reason, avoids some issues with seasonality. The choice of year doesn't matter.)\n",

    "# Create Demographically Adjusted Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will demographically adjust the data to adjust for composition changes over time (based on observables).  As employment rates fell, they fell more for low educated workers than high educated workers.  That means the average wages you measured previously will actually be comparing different types of workers in 2010 relative to 2006. To demographically adjust the data, create age-skill groups in each year. Use 5 year age ranges (25-29, 30-34, etc.) and 5 education groupings (less than high school, high school only, some college, bachelor’s degree, more than a bachelor’s degree). Compute wages within these cells for each year (again weighting the data using survey weights). However, when computing time series trends, we will fix the population weights for each cell at year 2000 levels (i.e., the share of the population that lives in each group). So, for each year, you will compute a measure of wages by multiplying the means within each cell during that year by the 2000 shares of population in each cell (and then sum across cells within the year). By doing this, you will be able to compute a demographically adjusted wage series during the 2000 – 2016 period (we have data up to 2017, but the wage variables refer to the wages earned in the previous year). We will discuss how these demographically adjusted wage series compare to your series from before."

    "> We could impute wages for those not working.  So your sample will now expand to all workers – even those without a measured wage.   We can do the imputation in a crude way. Using this new sample, define demographic groups by age-skill for each year. For each person without out a wage in a given year – match them to their demographic cell in that year.  For your imputation, assign those with a missing wage in that year to the 33rd percentile of the wages within that cell (for that year).   Note – those with the highest wages will be at the 99th percentile.  This assumes that those with a missing wage (of a given age-skill type) are disproportionately drawn from the bottom part of their age-skill wage distribution.   Still adjust the wages for changing demographic composition by fixing the weights for each demographic cell at their 2000 level (using the full sample including the zeros).  \n",
