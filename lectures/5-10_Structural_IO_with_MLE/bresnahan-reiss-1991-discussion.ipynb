    "The abstract of the paper is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> This paper proposes an empirical framework for measuring the effects of entry in concentrated markets. Building on models of entry in atomistically competitive markets, we show how the number of producers in an oligopolistic market varies with changes in demand and market competition. These analytical results structure our empirical analysis of competition in five retail and professional industries. Using data on geographically isolated monopolies, duopolies, and oligopolies, we study the relationship between the number of firms in a market, market size, and competition. Our empirical results suggest that competitive conduct changes quickly as the number of incumbents increases. In markets with five or fewer incumbents, almost all variation in competitive conduct occurs with the entry of the second or third firm. Surprisingly, once the market has between three and five firms, the next entrant has little effect on competitive conduct.\n"

Most oligopoly theories predict that continued demand growth will encourage entry, thereby reducing incumbents' margins. Eventually, as market demand grows large relative to minimum efficient scale, firms' price-cost margins will tend to competitive levels. In figure 1, this occurs when the per firm demand curve D, passes through the bottom of average total cost.\n",

Because we rarely observe margins, we instead use entry thresholds to draw inferences about margins.

From comparative statics on the first-order conditions for quantities and the zero-profit conditions governing entry, we can show that if firms have the same costs and if entry does not change competitive conduct, then $s_{N+1}/s_N= 1$. Thus departures of successive entry threshold ratios from one measure whether competitive conduct changes as the number of firms increases. Notice that this statis- tic does not measure the level of competition. Instead, it measures how the level changes with the number of firms."
